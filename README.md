# React Budget Calculator

## Introduction

This project based on IBM open source project: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/ejtos-react_budget_app

I fixed the warning windows bug to display appropriate message according to the error and reinforced currency switching system.


## Tech Stack

- Calculate remaining budget amount after enter spendings for each department
- Set limits for the maximum budget (20000), proper warning message will show up if exceeded
- Adjust spendings by clicking add/reduce button or submit a new allocation form
- Lock the allocation form that only accepts numbers for the amount of money
- Change currency used for the budget calculation by a drop down menu the change will be applied everywhere on the page
